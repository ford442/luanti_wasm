-- Stage amps: a song played out of two cabinets.
--
-- Luanti only places a sound in the world if it is a single-channel Ogg. A
-- stereo file is played with no position at all (and the engine warns about
-- it), so a stereo mix cannot come out of a pair of cabs. Each song therefore
-- ships as two mono files cut from the original left and right channels:
--
--   lw_amps_<song>_l.ogg   the original left channel  -> audience-left cab
--   lw_amps_<song>_r.ogg   the original right channel -> audience-right cab
--
-- `_l` / `_r` rather than `.1` / `.2`, because `<name>.<digit>.ogg` is a random
-- sound group and the engine would play only one of the two.
--
-- The pair is started together, in the same server step, with the same
-- `start_time`, so the stereo image survives: a visitor standing between the
-- cabs hears the mix the way it was recorded. A visitor who walks in later is
-- given the pair at `start_time = elapsed % length` and lands in time with
-- everyone else. That clock is also what the dance director (lw_dance) reads,
-- which is how the band on stage stays on the beat of the song coming out of
-- the cabs.

-- Positional gain is the level at three nodes from the source. It does not get

--   registered, so a stage waiting for its songs stays quiet instead of
--   playing silence.
-- * `playlist`: the stage it belongs to (`lw_amps.playlist`), so a map can say
